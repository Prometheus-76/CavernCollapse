To create new samples within the default dataset:
1. Create a new custom dataset
2. Assemble samples within there
3. Locate samples within file directory and drag the files (not parent dataset folder) into the Assets>Resources>SampleData folder in the project panel
4. Files should be automatically converted from .ccd to .txt by the SampleImporter script
